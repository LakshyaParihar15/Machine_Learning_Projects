Data Science and Machine Learning Projects

Welcome to my repository of data science and machine learning projects! This collection showcases my skills in solving real-world problems using data analysis and machine learning techniques.

Overview

This repository contains several projects covering a variety of topics in data science and machine learning. Each project is implemented in Python and includes a Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) where I explore the problem, analyze the data, and build predictive models.

Requirements

The projects are developed using Python and require the following libraries:

- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn (for some projects)
- Jupyter Notebook
